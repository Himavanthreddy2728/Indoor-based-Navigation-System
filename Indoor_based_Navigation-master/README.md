# Indoor_based_Navigation
Whenever we visit shopping malls or Airports, it becomes a tedious task to locate our boarding terminal or the shop that we want to visit. This problem can be solved by using Indoor Location and Navigation. Now-a-days we carry our Smartphones wherever we go, also almost every Smartphone have basic modules like Camera, GPS, Internet embedded into them. With the help of this, we can navigate a user to his desired destination or his boarding terminal. This is just Google Maps but works Indoors!!!
